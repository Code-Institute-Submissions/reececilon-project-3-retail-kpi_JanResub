# Retail KPIs
Retail KPIs is an app designed for retailers to analyse customer data and calculate store key performance indicators (KPIs). The user is able to update a spreadheet with sales figures, obtain automated figures for KPIs and get a predicted sales target for the next day, based on data collected from previous selling days. This allows the user to automatically update a spreadsheet with data, and obtain KPI results for easy analysis of store performance and customer purchase data.
